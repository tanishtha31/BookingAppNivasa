#### Logic

🔐 User Authentication
	•	Register & Login functionality is built using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
	•	Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before saving to MongoDB.
	•	On successful login, a token is sent to the client and used to access protected routes (e.g., bookings).

🏨 Hotel Listing
	•	When the user visits the home page, the frontend makes a GET request to api.
	•	The backend fetches all hotels from MongoDB and sends them as JSON to the client.
	•	Hotels are displayed dynamically using React.

📅 Booking Logic
	•	Users select check-in and check-out dates, which are validated on the client.
	•	On submission, a POST request is sent to api of bookings.
	•	The backend:
	•	Verifies user via token.
	•	Checks room availability.
	•	Creates a booking document with user ID, hotel ID, and dates.
	•	Booking confirmation is sent back to the client.

🧾 Booking History
	•	When the user navigates to their profile/dashboard, a GET request is sent to /api/bookings/:userId.
	•	The backend fetches all bookings associated with that user.
	•	Results are shown in a simple history table or card view.
